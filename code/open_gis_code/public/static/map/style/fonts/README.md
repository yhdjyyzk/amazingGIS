# Noto unicode font for OpenStreetMap & MapBox GL

Manually merged Google Noto fonts (https://www.google.com/get/noto/) to provide glyphs for unicode OpenStreetMap labels in TileServer GL, MapBox GL JS, Android and iOS.

Feel free to use these fonts in your styles on your servers, but you must keep the name of the font as it is in this repository - to credit KlokanTech for the work we have done on merging the Google Noto.

Bugs should be reported under [Issues](https://github.com/klokantech/klokantech-gl-fonts/issues) in this repository.

TrueType variant of the fonts for use in MapBox Studio or on desktop can be downloaded too: https://github.com/klokantech/klokantech-gl-fonts/releases/download/v1.0.0/ttf.zip
